\label{wordplay}

This chapter presents the second case study, which involves
solving word puzzles by searching for words that have certain
properties.  For example, we'll find the longest palindromes
in English and search for words whose letters appear in
alphabetical order.  And I will present another program development
plan: reduction to a previously solved problem.

这一章将介绍第二个案例研究，即通过查找具有特定属性的单词来解答字谜游戏。
例如，我们将找出英文中最长的回文单词，以及字符按照字符表顺序出现的单词。
另外，我还将介绍另一种程序开发方法：简化为之前已解决的问题。

\section{Reading word lists  |  读取单词列表}
\label{wordlist}

For the exercises in this chapter we need a list of English words.
There are lots of word lists available on the Web, but the one most
suitable for our purpose is one of the word lists collected and
contributed to the public domain by Grady Ward as part of the Moby
lexicon project (see \url{http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby_Project}).  It
is a list of 113,809 official crosswords; that is, words that are
considered valid in crossword puzzles and other word games.  In the
Moby collection, the filename is {\tt 113809of.fic}; you can download
a copy, with the simpler name {\tt words.txt}, from
\url{http://thinkpython2.com/code/words.txt}.
\index{Moby Project}  \index{crosswords}

为了完成本章的习题，我们需要一个英语单词的列表。
网络上有许多单词列表，但是最符合我们目的列表之一是由 Grady
Ward收集并贡献给公众的列表，这也是Moby词典项目的一部分
（见：\url{http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby_Project}）。
它由 113,809 个填字游戏单词组成，即在填字游戏以及其它文字游戏中被认为有效的单词。
在 Moby 集合中，该列表的文件名是 113809of.fic ；你可以从 \url{http://thinkpython.com/code/words.txt} 下载一个拷贝，文件名已被简化为 words.txt。
\index{Moby Project}  \index{crosswords}

This file is in plain text, so you can open it with a text
editor, but you can also read it from Python.  The built-in
function {\tt open} takes the name of the file as a parameter
and returns a {\bf file object} you can use to read the file.

该文件是纯文本， 因此你可以用一个文本编辑器打开它， 但是你也可以从Python中读取它。 内建函数 \li{open} 接受文件名作为形参， 并返回一个 {\em 文件对象} (file object)， 你可以使用它读取该文件。

\index{open function}  \index{function!open}
\index{plain text}  \index{text!plain}
\index{object!file}  \index{file object}

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> fin = open('words.txt')
\end{lstlisting}

%
{\tt fin} is a common name for a file object used for input.  The file
object provides several methods for reading, including {\tt readline},
which reads characters from the file until it gets to a newline and
returns the result as a string: \index{readline method}
\index{method!readline}

\li{`fin} 是输入文件对象的一个常用名。 该文件对象提供了几个读取方法，
包括 \li{readline}， 其从文件中读取字符直到碰到新行， 并将结果作为字符串返回：
\index{method!readline}

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> fin.readline()
'aa\r\n'
\end{lstlisting}

%
The first word in this particular list is ``aa'', which is a kind of
lava.  The sequence \verb"\r\n" represents two whitespace characters,
a carriage return and a newline, that separate this word from the
next.

在此列表中，第一个单词是 ``aa''， 它是一类熔岩的名称。 序列 \li{\r\n} 代表两个空白字符， 回车和换行， 它们将这个单词和下一个分开。

The file object keeps track of where it is in the file, so
if you call {\tt readline} again, you get the next word:

此文件对象跟踪它在文件中的位置，
所以如果你再次调用 \li{readline}，你获得下一个单词：

\begin{lstlisting}
>>> fin.readline()
'aah\r\n'
\end{lstlisting}

%
The next word is ``aah'', which is a perfectly legitimate
word, so stop looking at me like that.
Or, if it's the whitespace that's bothering you,
we can get rid of it with the string method {\tt strip}:

下一个单词是 ``aah''，不要惊讶，它是一个完全合法的单词。
或者， 如果空格困扰了你， 我们可以用字符串方法 \li{strip} 删掉它：
\index{strip method}  \index{method!strip}
\index{strip 方法}  \index{方法!strip}


\begin{lstlisting}
>>> line = fin.readline()
>>> word = line.strip()
>>> word
'aahed'
\end{lstlisting}

%
You can also use a file object as part of a {\tt for} loop.
This program reads {\tt words.txt} and prints each word, one
per line:

你也可以将文件对象用做 \li{for} 循环的一部分。
此程序读取 \li{words.txt} 并打印每个单词，每行一个：
\index{open function}  \index{function!open}

\begin{lstlisting}
fin = open('words.txt')
for line in fin:
    word = line.strip()
    print(word)
\end{lstlisting}

%

\section{Exercises  |  练习}

There are solutions to these exercises in the next section.
You should at least attempt each one before you read the solutions.

\hyperref[search]{下一节}将给出了这些习题的答案。
在你看答案之前，应该试着解答一下。

\begin{exercise}
Write a program that reads {\tt words.txt} and prints only the
words with more than 20 characters (not counting whitespace).

编程写一个程序，使得它可以读取 \li{words.txt}　， 然后只打印出那些长度超过 20 个字符的单词 （不包括空格）。
\index{whitespace}

\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}

In 1939 Ernest Vincent Wright published a 50,000 word novel called
{\em Gadsby} that does not contain the letter ``e''.  Since ``e'' is
the most common letter in English, that's not easy to do.

1939年，Ernest Vincent Wright 出版了一本名为 《Gadsby》 的小说，
该小说里完全没有使用字符 ``e''。 由于 ``e'' 是英文中最常用的字符， 因此写出这本书并不容易。

In fact, it is difficult to construct a solitary thought without using
that most common symbol.  It is slow going at first, but with caution
and hours of training you can gradually gain facility.

事实上，不使用这个最常用的字符来构建一个简单的想法都是很难的。
开始进展缓慢，但是经过有意识的、长时间的训练，你可以逐渐地熟练。

All right, I'll stop now.

好啦，不说题外话了，我们开始编程练习。

Write a function called \verb"has_no_e" that returns {\tt True} if
the given word doesn't have the letter ``e'' in it.

写一个叫做 \li{has_no_e} 的函数， 如果给定的单词中不包含字符 ``e''，返回 \li{True} 。

Modify your program from the previous section to print only the words
that have no ``e'' and compute the percentage of the words in the list
that have no ``e''.

修改上一节中的程序， 只打印不包含 ``e'' 的单词，并且计算列表中不含 ``e'' 单词的比例。
\index{lipogram}

\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}

Write a function named {\tt avoids}
that takes a word and a string of forbidden letters, and
that returns {\tt True} if the word doesn't use any of the forbidden
letters.

编写一个名为 \li{avoids} 的函数，接受一个单词和一个指定禁止使用字符的字符串，
如果单词中不包含任意被禁止的字符，则返回 \li{True} 。

Modify your program to prompt the user to enter a string
of forbidden letters and then print the number of words that
don't contain any of them.
Can you find a combination of 5 forbidden letters that
excludes the smallest number of words?

修改你的程序，提示用户输入一个禁止使用的字符，然后打印不包含这些字符的单词的数量。
你能找到一个5个禁止使用字符的组合，使得其排除的单词数目最少么？

\end{exercise}



\begin{exercise}

Write a function named \verb"uses_only" that takes a word and a
string of letters, and that returns {\tt True} if the word contains
only letters in the list.  Can you make a sentence using only the
letters {\tt acefhlo}?  Other than ``Hoe alfalfa?''

\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}

Write a function named \verb"uses_all" that takes a word and a
string of required letters, and that returns {\tt True} if the word
uses all the required letters at least once.  How many words are there
that use all the vowels {\tt aeiou}?  How about {\tt aeiouy}?

\end{exercise}


\begin{exercise}

Write a function called \verb"is_abecedarian" that returns
{\tt True} if the letters in a word appear in alphabetical order
(double letters are ok).
How many abecedarian words are there?

\index{abecedarian}

\end{exercise}



\section{Search}
\label{search}
\index{search pattern}  \index{pattern!search}

All of the exercises in the previous section have something
in common; they can be solved with the search pattern we saw
in Section~\ref{find}.  The simplest example is:

\begin{lstlisting}
def has_no_e(word):
    for letter in word:
        if letter == 'e':
            return False
    return True
\end{lstlisting}
%
The {\tt for} loop traverses the characters in {\tt word}.  If we find
the letter ``e'', we can immediately return {\tt False}; otherwise we
have to go to the next letter.  If we exit the loop normally, that
means we didn't find an ``e'', so we return {\tt True}.
\index{traversal}

\index{in operator}  \index{operator!in}
You could write this function more concisely using the {\tt in}
operator, but I started with this version because it
demonstrates the logic of the search pattern.

\index{generalization}
{\tt avoids} is a more general version of \verb"has_no_e" but it
has the same structure:

\begin{lstlisting}
def avoids(word, forbidden):
    for letter in word:
        if letter in forbidden:
            return False
    return True
\end{lstlisting}
%
We can return {\tt False} as soon as we find a forbidden letter;
if we get to the end of the loop, we return {\tt True}.

\verb"uses_only" is similar except that the sense of the condition
is reversed:

\begin{lstlisting}
def uses_only(word, available):
    for letter in word:
        if letter not in available:
            return False
    return True
\end{lstlisting}
%
Instead of a list of forbidden letters, we have a list of available
letters.  If we find a letter in {\tt word} that is not in
{\tt available}, we can return {\tt False}.

\verb"uses_all" is similar except that we reverse the role
of the word and the string of letters:

\begin{lstlisting}
def uses_all(word, required):
    for letter in required:
        if letter not in word:
            return False
    return True
\end{lstlisting}
%
Instead of traversing the letters in {\tt word}, the loop
traverses the required letters.  If any of the required letters
do not appear in the word, we can return {\tt False}.
\index{traversal}

If you were really thinking like a computer scientist, you would
have recognized that \verb"uses_all" was an instance of a
previously solved problem, and you would have written:

\begin{lstlisting}
def uses_all(word, required):
    return uses_only(required, word)
\end{lstlisting}
%
This is an example of a program development plan called {\bf
  reduction to a previously solved problem}, which means that you
recognize the problem you are working on as an instance of a solved
problem and apply an existing solution.  \index{reduction to a
  previously solved problem} \index{development plan!reduction}


\section{Looping with indices}
\index{looping!with indices}
\index{index!looping with}

I wrote the functions in the previous section with {\tt for}
loops because I only needed the characters in the strings; I didn't
have to do anything with the indices.

For \verb"is_abecedarian" we have to compare adjacent letters,
which is a little tricky with a {\tt for} loop:

\begin{lstlisting}
def is_abecedarian(word):
    previous = word[0]
    for c in word:
        if c < previous:
            return False
        previous = c
    return True
\end{lstlisting}

An alternative is to use recursion:

\begin{lstlisting}
def is_abecedarian(word):
    if len(word) <= 1:
        return True
    if word[0] > word[1]:
        return False
    return is_abecedarian(word[1:])
\end{lstlisting}

Another option is to use a {\tt while} loop:

\begin{lstlisting}
def is_abecedarian(word):
    i = 0
    while i < len(word)-1:
        if word[i+1] < word[i]:
            return False
        i = i+1
    return True
\end{lstlisting}
%
The loop starts at {\tt i=0} and ends when {\tt i=len(word)-1}.  Each
time through the loop, it compares the $i$th character (which you can
think of as the current character) to the $i+1$th character (which you
can think of as the next).

If the next character is less than (alphabetically before) the current
one, then we have discovered a break in the abecedarian trend, and
we return {\tt False}.

If we get to the end of the loop without finding a fault, then the
word passes the test.  To convince yourself that the loop ends
correctly, consider an example like \verb"'flossy'".  The
length of the word is 6, so
the last time the loop runs is when {\tt i} is 4, which is the
index of the second-to-last character.  On the last iteration,
it compares the second-to-last character to the last, which is
what we want.
\index{palindrome}

Here is a version of \verb"is_palindrome" (see
Exercise~\ref{palindrome}) that uses two indices; one starts at the
beginning and goes up; the other starts at the end and goes down.

\begin{lstlisting}
def is_palindrome(word):
    i = 0
    j = len(word)-1

    while i<j:
        if word[i] != word[j]:
            return False
        i = i+1
        j = j-1

    return True
\end{lstlisting}

Or we could reduce to a previously solved
problem and write:
\index{reduction to a previously solved problem}
\index{development plan!reduction}

\begin{lstlisting}
def is_palindrome(word):
    return is_reverse(word, word)
\end{lstlisting}
%
Using \verb"is_reverse" from Section~\ref{isreverse}.


\section{Debugging}
\index{debugging}
\index{testing!is hard}
\index{program testing}

Testing programs is hard.  The functions in this chapter are
relatively easy to test because you can check the results by hand.
Even so, it is somewhere between difficult and impossible to choose a
set of words that test for all possible errors.

Taking \verb"has_no_e" as an example, there are two obvious
cases to check: words that have an `e' should return {\tt False}, and
words that don't should return {\tt True}.  You should have no
trouble coming up with one of each.

Within each case, there are some less obvious subcases.  Among the
words that have an ``e'', you should test words with an ``e'' at the
beginning, the end, and somewhere in the middle.  You should test long
words, short words, and very short words, like the empty string.  The
empty string is an example of a {\bf special case}, which is one of
the non-obvious cases where errors often lurk.
\index{special case}

In addition to the test cases you generate, you can also test
your program with a word list like {\tt words.txt}.  By scanning
the output, you might be able to catch errors, but be careful:
you might catch one kind of error (words that should not be
included, but are) and not another (words that should be included,
but aren't).

In general, testing can help you find bugs, but it is not easy to
generate a good set of test cases, and even if you do, you can't
be sure your program is correct.
According to a legendary computer scientist:
\index{testing!and absence of bugs}

Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to
show their absence!

\index{double letters}

This question is based on a Puzzler that was broadcast on the radio
program {\em Car Talk}
(\url{http://www.cartalk.com/content/puzzlers}):

\begin{quote}
Give me a word with three consecutive double letters. I'll give you a
couple of words that almost qualify, but don't. For example, the word
committee, c-o-m-m-i-t-t-e-e. It would be great except for the `i' that
sneaks in there. Or Mississippi: M-i-s-s-i-s-s-i-p-p-i. If you could
take out those i's it would work. But there is a word that has three
consecutive pairs of letters and to the best of my knowledge this may
be the only word. Of course there are probably 500 more but I can only
think of one. What is the word?

\begin{quote}
``I was driving on the highway the other day and I happened to
notice my odometer. Like most odometers, it shows six digits,
in whole miles only. So, if my car had 300,000
miles, for example, I'd see 3-0-0-0-0-0.

``Now, what I saw that day was very interesting. I noticed that the
last 4 digits were palindromic; that is, they read the same forward as
backward. For example, 5-4-4-5 is a palindrome, so my odometer
could have read 3-1-5-4-4-5.

``One mile later, the last 5 numbers were palindromic. For example, it
could have read 3-6-5-4-5-6.  One mile after that, the middle 4 out of
6 numbers were palindromic.  And you ready for this? One mile later,
all 6 were palindromic!

\begin{quote}
``Recently I had a visit with my mom and we realized that
the two digits that make up my age when reversed resulted in her
age. For example, if she's 73, I'm 37. We wondered how often this has
happened over the years but we got sidetracked with other topics and
we never came up with an answer.

``When I got home I figured out that the digits of our ages have been
reversible six times so far. I also figured out that if we're lucky it
would happen again in a few years, and if we're really lucky it would
happen one more time after that. In other words, it would have
happened 8 times over all. So the question is, how old am I now?''
